# Tom Reid's Gatsby Blog!

This is my template for a simple gatsby blog. To get started clone this repo, make sure you have npm and gatsby installed, navigate into the main folder and type ```npm install``` and then ```gatsby develop```

## Todo

* Clean up the node modules
* Clean up the CSS (fully migrate to grid)
* Finish writing base content
* Write guide on deploying with netlify (awesome)
* Upload my content
